# How to create a basic function in javascript

## About javascript : 

JavaScript, the versatile language, is like a Swiss Army knife for web development. It empowers interactivity and dynamism on websites. JavaScript functions are its building blocks, essential tools to create logic and perform actions. They're the behind-the-scenes magicians making web applications come alive with their code spells.

## How to create a function : 

```

function loggingToConsole() {
   console.log("Hello world");
};


```

This is a basic javascript function and we'll discuss more later on!
## Thank you!
